# Workday-Planner-Project

This is a webpage which allows the user to organize their workday. For added organization, the user will be able to add appointments to their workday planner by hourly timeslot, which shows the current, future, and past appointments.

# Description

The developer was tasked to create a workday planner which was separated by an hourly timeslot, of which we were given a starter HTML and CSS file. The developer had to organize and create a row of timeslots, which categorized the companys typical hours of operation. The developer then set in a comment section as well as a save feature, which allows the user to save any entered comments. The developer entered in a timestamp at the top, which allowed the user to see the current date and time, and also allowed for the timeslots to be organized further when adding different appointments, by current, past and future appointments based off of their color.
